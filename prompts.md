Reference:
Build my open source SBDK.dev offering. SBDK.dev is a developer sandbox framework designed for local-first data pipeline development using DLT, DuckDB, and dbt. It includes synthetic data ingestion, transform pipelines, local execution tooling, a CLI, and webhook support. It’s the foundation for a future commercial SaaS version built on Snowflake Native Apps with AI-assisted development, sandbox orchestration, and telemetry. Reference the self-contained @duckdb-dev-env/ folder of a complete dlt + duckdb pipeline. My spec is in @README.md. use context7 mcp server to pull accurate examples and docs.
