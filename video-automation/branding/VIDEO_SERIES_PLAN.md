## Content Templates

### Opening Hook Template
```
"What if I told you that you could build a complete data pipeline,
with real data, running real analytics queries, in just 30 seconds?

And what if that pipeline used the same tools as Netflix, Airbnb,
and other data-driven companies, but ran entirely on your laptop
with zero cloud costs?

That's exactly what we're going to do today with SBDK.dev."
```

### Command Showcase Template
```
"Let me show you how simple this really is.

[Terminal opens]

$ pip install sbdk-dev
[Installation progress]

$ sbdk init my_analytics_project
[Project creation animation]

$ cd my_analytics_project && sbdk run
[Pipeline execution with progress bars]

And that's it. We now have 10,000 users, 50,000 events,
and 20,000 orders, all loaded into a DuckDB database
with clean, tested analytics models ready to query."
```

### Comparison Template
```
"Let's compare this to the traditional approach:

Traditional Stack:
- Docker Compose setup: 2 hours
- Database configuration: 1 hour  
- Pipeline development: 4 hours
- Testing and debugging: 2 hours
- Total: 9+ hours and $200/month

SBDK Approach:
- Installation: 10 seconds
- Project setup: 20 seconds
- Working pipeline: Immediately
- Total: 30 seconds and $0/month

That's a 1,080x improvement in setup time."
```

## Thumbnail Strategy

### High-CTR Elements
- **Bright contrasts:** Teal (#00D4AA) on dark backgrounds
- **Clear benefit text:** "11x FASTER", "100% LOCAL", "$0 COST"
- **Terminal screenshots:** Real code, not stock images
- **Before/after splits:** Complexity vs simplicity
- **Emoji accents:** ðŸš€ âš¡ ðŸ’° for emotional triggers

### A/B Testing Plan
Test thumbnail variations:
1. Split-screen comparison vs single hero image
2. Command-focused vs benefit-focused text
3. Different color schemes within brand guidelines
4. Various emoji and icon treatments
