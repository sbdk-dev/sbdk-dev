## 🔧 Fixed All Documentation Issues

### 1. ✅ **Broken References Fixed**
**Issue**: Demo project README referenced non-existent paths
```markdown
❌ WAS: "Check the main project README.md at /Users/mattstrautmann/Documents/GitHub/sbdk-dev/README.md"
✅ NOW: "Check the main project README.md or the comprehensive documentation in the docs/ folder."
```

### 2. ✅ **Confusing "_fixed" Tags Removed**
**Issue**: Files named with "_fixed" caused confusion
```
❌ WAS: my_project_fixed/ (confusing)
✅ NOW: my_project_example/ (clear purpose)

❌ WAS: run_dbt_fixed.py (temporary)  
✅ NOW: Enhanced files with clear names
```

### 3. ✅ **Documentation Paths Aligned**
**Issue**: Inconsistent references between documents
```
✅ FIXED: All documentation now uses consistent, relative paths
✅ FIXED: Cross-references work correctly
✅ FIXED: No more broken links or missing references
```

### 4. ✅ **Database Files Optimized**
**Issue**: Confusing database file names in demo_project
```
❌ WAS: demo_project.duckdb, dev.duckdb, sample.duckdb (unclear)
✅ NOW: starter-database.duckdb, development-database.duckdb, sample-data-database.duckdb (clear)
```
