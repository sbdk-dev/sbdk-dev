## 🌟 The Problem with Data Pipelines Today

Traditional data pipeline tools require:
- ☁️ **Cloud dependencies** (expensive, complex)
- 🐌 **Slow setup** (hours of configuration)
- 🔧 **Complex tooling** (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- 💸 **High costs** (cloud compute, storage)
- 🐛 **Poor local development** (impossible to debug)

## ✨ SBDK.dev: The Solution You've Been Waiting For

**SBDK.dev** is the **first local-first data pipeline toolkit** that gives you enterprise-grade data processing with **zero cloud dependencies**. Built on modern Python foundations with **DLT**, **DuckDB**, and **dbt**.

### 🎯 Why Developers Choose SBDK.dev

```bash
# Traditional approach: 4 hours, 12 services, $200/month
docker-compose up -d postgres redis kafka airflow
helm install dbt-cloud --set replicas=3
kubectl apply -f pipeline-configs/

# SBDK.dev approach: 30 seconds, 1 command, $0/month
sbdk init my_pipeline && cd my_pipeline && sbdk run --visual
```

---

## 🚀 Get Started in 30 Seconds

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
# Lightning-fast installation with uv (11x faster than pip)
uv pip install sbdk-dev

# Create your first data pipeline
sbdk init my_analytics_project
cd my_analytics_project

# Run with beautiful visual interface
sbdk run --visual
```

### Option 2: Development Installation
```bash
# Install uv for blazing-fast package management
