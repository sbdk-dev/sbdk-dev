## 🌟 The Problem with Data Pipelines Today

Traditional data pipeline tools require:
- ☁️ **Cloud dependencies** (expensive, complex)
- 🐌 **Slow setup** (hours of configuration)
- 🔧 **Complex tooling** (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- 💸 **High costs** (cloud compute, storage)
- 🐛 **Poor local development** (impossible to debug)

## ✨ SBDK.dev: Your Data Pipeline Sandbox

**SBDK.dev** (Sandbox Development Kit) is a **comprehensive sandbox framework** for data pipeline development that provides a complete local-first environment. Perfect for prototyping, learning, and developing data solutions before deploying to production systems.

### 🎯 Why Use SBDK as Your Development Sandbox

```bash
# Traditional approach: Complex setup, cloud dependencies, expensive
docker-compose up -d postgres redis kafka airflow  # Hours of setup
aws configure && kubectl apply -f configs/         # Cloud complexity

# SBDK sandbox approach: Instant local development environment
sbdk init my_pipeline && cd my_pipeline && sbdk run  # 30 seconds to data
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Sandbox Setup

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
# Lightning-fast installation with uv (11x faster than pip)
uv pip install sbdk-dev

# Create your first data pipeline
sbdk init my_analytics_project
cd my_analytics_project

# Run with intelligent interactive interface
sbdk run --visual
```

### Option 2: Development Installation
```bash
# Install uv for blazing-fast package management
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/sbdk-dev/sbdk-dev.git
cd sbdk-dev && uv sync --extra dev
uv run sbdk version

# Create your first data pipeline
uv run sbdk init my_analytics_project
cd my_analytics_project

# Run with intelligent interactive interface
uv run sbdk run --visual
```

**🎉 That's it!** Your DuckDB database now contains production-ready analytics data.

    for customer in get_customers():
        # Complex business logic
        ltv = calculate_lifetime_value(customer)
        churn_risk = predict_churn_probability(customer)
        
        yield {
            "customer_id": customer.id,
            "lifetime_value": ltv,
            "churn_risk": churn_risk,
            "segment": classify_customer_segment(ltv, churn_risk),

        }
```

### Advanced dbt Transformations
```sql
-- dbt/models/marts/customer_intelligence.sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

with customer_metrics as (
  select
    customer_id,
    sum(order_total) as total_revenue,
    count(*) as order_count,
    avg(order_total) as avg_order_value,
    max(order_date) as last_order_date,
    min(order_date) as first_order_date
  from {{ ref('stg_orders') }}
  group by customer_id
),

customer_segments as (
  select *,
    case 
      when total_revenue > 1000 and order_count > 10 then 'VIP'
      when total_revenue > 500 then 'Premium' 
      when order_count > 5 then 'Regular'
      else 'New'
    end as customer_segment
  from customer_metrics
)
